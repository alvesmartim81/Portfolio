As i start my web development career, a portfolio was one of the most sugested projects, and here is mine.
I started by creating a scetch in my notebook to have an idea of what it would look.
After that i divided my project in three parts: header, main and footer.
In the header, the idea was to add in the left corner the date of the last time it was written, and, in the middle, the title "Portfolio".
I know the title wasnt creative but im in programing to program, not ot be the most creative person in the world.
Finaly, to add some beauty, i added some shadows and a background image.
In the main  part, i had the goal to add an image, a biography and two lists, one for abilities and other for projects created.
I used the grid display that allowed me to put one in each grid as i creted two rows and two collumns.
I added a shadow and a transition to the image when the mouse passed over it, making the image bigger and the shadow more noticeable.
The lists where a ul and a ol , just to show that i can work with both of them.
The final step was to add a footer wich had an email contact and a phone number contact, none of wich where real so dont try to copntact them.I added a background image which is the same as the header.
To finish this project, i made a @media in order to my website be compatible with smaller devices, in wich i diminished the size of everything and changed the display to flex and the flex direction to collumn.
This is everything i have to tell you about my projetc, it was a very fun one, to see everything work as expected is one of the best feelings ever.
Hope you liked it and sorry for the gramatical errors in the texts, i happen to be portuguese and my english without the keybord helping isnt that much great.
